- Level 600: 71 questions

### After:
- Level 200: 45 questions (Easy)
- Level 400: 49 questions (Medium)
- Level 600: 61 questions (Hard)

## Level Guidelines:

## Files modified:
- `flags.json` - Updated difficulty levels for better balance
- Created backup files for safety

This rebalancing makes level 600 truly challenging (only very difficult flags) and level 400 more reasonable (countries that some people know but not everyone).
